   * However, this first solution won't allow you to animate step by step what happened: the roll, then the pawn movement.
   * "getAutomaticMove" is the solution to trigger multiple moves in a single action, and still allow for step by step animations.
   * => in that case, "RollDice" could set "pawnMovement = x" somewhere in the game state. Then getAutomaticMove will return "MovePawn" when
   * "pawnMovement" is defined in the state.
   * Of course, you must return nothing once all the consequences triggered by a decision are completed.
   * VERY IMPORTANT: you should never change the game state in here. Indeed, getAutomaticMove will never be called in replays, for example.
   *
   * @return The next automatic consequence that should be played in current game state.
